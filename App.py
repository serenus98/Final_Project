# Import the Tkinter library for GUI development
import tkinter as tk
# If you're using Python 2, you would import it as:
# import Tkinter as tk
# Create the main application window
root = tk.Tk()
# Additional libraries can be imported as needed for your specific project
# For example, if you plan to work with dropdown menu options, you might import tkinter.ttk
# import tkinter.ttk as ttk
