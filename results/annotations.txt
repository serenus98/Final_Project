ENOG410VKIB	31	B	Atypical histone H2A which can replace conventional H2A in some nucleosomes and is associated with active transcription and mRNA processing. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. Nucleosomes containing this histone are less rigid and organize less DNA than canonical nucleosomes in vivo. They are enriched in actively transcribed genes and associate with the elongating form of RNA polymerase. They associate with spliceosome components and are required for mRNA splicing. May participate in spermatogenesis

ENOG410WE9S	11	K	Reduces p53 TP53 transactivation function through recruitment of HDAC3 to p53 TP53 transcription sites. Also represses p73 TP73 activity. Proposed to enhance ubiquitin ligase activity of RING-type zinc finger-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. In vitro enhances ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM28 and stimulates p53 TP53 ubiquitination by TRIM28 potentially in presence of Ubl-conjugating enzyme UBE2H. Proposed to act through recruitment and or stabilization of the Ubl-conjugating enzyme (E2) at the E3 substrate complex. May play a role in embryonal development and tumor transformation or aspects of tumor progression. In vitro promotes cell viability in melanoma cell lines. Antigen recognized on a melanoma by autologous cytolytic T- lymphocytes. Negatively regulates acetylation and sumoylation of PML and represses PML-induced p53 TP53 acetylation and activation
